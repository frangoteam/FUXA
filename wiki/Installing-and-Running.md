### 2° Option - Install from source
[Download the latest release](https://github.com/frangoteam/FUXA/releases) and unpack it

You need to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
- Recommended: Node.js 18 LTS

**Note** Starting from FUXA 1.2.7, Node.js 14 and older versions are not supported due to upstream dependency updates.

**WARNING** On Linux systems (especially Raspberry Pi), installing native dependencies with Node.js 18 may require additional build tools.
If you do not intend to use specific features, you can safely remove them from ```server/package.json```:
- Remove ```node-snap7``` if you do not need Siemens S7 communication
- Remove ```odbc``` if you do not need external database connectivity

```
cd ./server
npm install
npm start
```

Open up a browser (better Chrome) and navigate to http://localhost:1881
