```
docker pull frangoteam/fuxa:latest
docker run -d -p 1881:1881 frangoteam/fuxa:latest

// persistent storage of application data (project), daq (tags history), logs and images (resource)

// with Docker compose
// persistent storage will be at ./appdata ./db ./logs and ./images
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frangoteam/FUXA/master/compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

### Install from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frangoteam/fuxa)

You need to have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) Version 18.

**WARNING** In linux with nodejs Version 18 the installation could be a challenge.
If you don't intend communicate with Siemens PLCs via S7 (node-snap7 library) you can install from [NPM @frangoteam/fuxa-min](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frangoteam/fuxa-min)

```
npm install -g --unsafe-perm @frangoteam/fuxa
fuxa
```

### Install from source
[Download the latest release](https://github.com/frangoteam/FUXA/releases) and unpack it

You need to have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) Version 18.

**WARNING** In linux with nodejs Version 18 the installation could be a challenge.
If you don't intend to communicate with Siemens PLCs via S7, you can remove the ```node-snap7``` library from the ```server/package.json```. Similarly, if you don't intend to use ODBC to communicate with an external database, you can remove the ```odbc``` library from the ```server/package.json```.

```
cd ./server
npm install
npm start
```

Open up a browser (better Chrome) and navigate to http://localhost:1881

**Note** If you intend to use nodejs version 14, please remove odbc from the package.json dependencies. nodejs 14 may have compatibility issues with certain versions of odbc, which could lead to installation errors.

### Creating the Electron Application
Electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. An Electron application is standalone, meaning it can be run independently on your desktop without needing a web browser.

To create the Electron application, you need to have node.js 18 installed. Follow these steps:

Build Server and Client First
```
cd ./server
npm install
cd ../client
npm install
npm run build
```

Packaging
```
cd ./app
npm install
npm run package
```

After following these steps, you will have a standalone Electron application for FUXA. The application can be found in the ./app directory.

## Usage
- Look the guide in [wiki](https://github.com/frangoteam/FUXA/wiki) pages
- Look video from [frangoteam](https://www.youtube.com/@umbertonocelli5301)
- Look video from [Fusion Automate - Urvish Nakum](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxrSjjYyzaaK8uY3kVaFzfGnwhVXiCEAO&si=aU1OxgkUvLQ3bXHq)

## To Debug (Full Stack)
Install and start to serve the frontend
```
cd ./client
npm install
npm start
```

Start the Server and Client (Browser) in Debug Mode
```
In vscode: Debug ‘Server & Client’
```

## To Build
Build the frontend for production
```
cd ./client
ng build --configuration=production
```
