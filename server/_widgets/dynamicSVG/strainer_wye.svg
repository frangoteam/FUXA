    Variables with the following prefix:

    _pb_ = bool   parameter ( true or false )
    _pn_ = number parameter ( Int, Float, Real etc )
    _ps_ = string parameter ( string can be entered directly )
    _pc_ = color parameter in hex color code ( #00ff00ff )

    Indicate variable type to be used in Fuxa Properties and binding of Tags, Important! they have to be place within:

    //!export-start
    let _pn_setState = 0;
    //!export-end

  

    There are 2x Functions to handle sending and receiving data between Fuxa and the SVG

    // Recieve Variables From Fuxa
    function putValue(id, value) { } 
    
    // Send Variables To Fuxa
    function postValue(id, value) {
      console.error('Not defined!');
    }

    The ID is the name of the variable _pn_setState for example and value is the value to be sent or received from Fuxa


    This SVG uses an INT/Number Variable to change the State and State of the SVG:

    0 = Off
    1 = Run
    2 = Warning
    3 = Fault
    4 = Invalid
    5 = Spare

    You can also use the bool field and this will change the state between 0 = off and 1 = run 

    You can also set the color for each state in Fuxa using HEX color code #b4b4b4
    The Default Blink Interval is 500ms but can also be changed in Fuxa in MS resolution


    This SVG is a bit complex as we have different shades of color, we calculate the offset colors
    The Shade Values are from -100 to 100, where 0 is not changed and -100 is black and 100 is white

    These style of SVGs can be found here:

    https://www.opto22.com/support/resources-tools/demos/svg-image-library

    By Adding this script to there downloaded SVG it should work without any modification ( may have to check group element names )
    Make sure the script is within the SVG tags
